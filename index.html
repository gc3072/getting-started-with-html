<h2>Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>

<h3>World Wide Web</h3>

<p>Also known as “<b>the web</b>” or “<b>www</b>” could be defined as a group of computers connected to each 
other using applications called browsers to request web pages over <b>HTTP</b>. 
(<em>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol</em>)
These pages are written in <b>HTML</b>. (<em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>)<br>
<br>
Here is a
<a href="http://techterms.com/definition/www"> link </a>
to a good high level definition for the <em><b>World Wide Web</b></em>.
</p>
<br>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML is made of:<br>
- Text content (<em>What you see</em>)<br>
-  Markup (<em>What it looks like</em>)<br>
-	References to other documents (<em>eg- videos and images</em>)<br>
-	Links to other pages (<em>URLs</em>)<br>
<br>
These HTML docs are grouped together or linked by URLs. (Uniform Resource Locator)
These are known as the global addresses of documents and other resources in the World Wide Web.Some examples of the types of files 
that can be found on the web are:

<br>
Plain text<br>
HTML<br>
Images<br>
Videos<br>
Music<br>
<br>
This was a good introduction to HTML and some basic HTLM Tags:

</p>

<b>HTML Vocabulary</b><br>
<br>
• Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag 
(< p > for example) and a closing tag, (< /p >). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the < br > tag).<br>
<br>
• Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. There are examples of inline tags and block 
tags. You can use these to manage whitespace. Inline tags just creates space around that line and does not do much else like creates 
a new line for text. Block creates whitespace around the content so there will be differences in how that text is displayed by the browser.<br>
<br>

<b>Basic HTML Markup examples:</b>
<br>
-	< b > contents < /b ><br>
b- bold
<br>
-	< em > contents < /em ><br>
em tag- emphasis – italics
<br>
-	< br > - break  <br>
<em> Note- <b>break</b> is an example of a void tag where there is no additional ending tag. </em> <br>
-	< p > - paragraph <br>
  < p > content < /p > <br>

<br>
<b>HTML Attributes</b><br>

< tag ATTR=”value” > contents < /tag > <br>
Anchor- < a > -link <br>
Example- < a href=www.reddit.com > derp < /a > <br>
note- <em>href</em>=attribute name and value is www.reddit.com<br>
<br>

Images- void tag <br>
< img > -images <br>
< img src=”URL” alt=”text” > <br>
<em>Note- The alt=<b>”text”</b> portion is required. It will not break anything, but it is the text the browser will display for broken requests and 
is used for the blind, so good habit to always add it.
